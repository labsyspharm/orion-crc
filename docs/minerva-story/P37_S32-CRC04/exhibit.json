    "Header": "Orion is an innovative multimodal imaging method that allows the rapid acquisition of 18-plex immunofluorescence and H&E images from the same sample. \n\nIt combines clinical-standard H&E images with multiplexed immunofluorescence, to leverage the advantages of both techniques. While H&E images provide robust morphological details, multiplexed immunofluorescence offers deep phenotyping capabilities. \n\nIn this Minerva story, we showcase how multimodal data obtained through Orion provides greater clarity than multiplexed immunofluorescence or H&E imaging data alone. \n\nWe used 40 samples, including the one presented here, to train machine learning models to identify potential biomarkers that can predict progression-free survival outcomes. _To delve deeper into the details of this particular specimen, you can refer to the **\u201cMetadata about this sample\u201d (page 15)**._ \n\n **Visit [tissue-atlas.org/atlas-datasets/lin-chen-campton-2023](https://www.tissue-atlas.org/atlas-datasets/lin-chen-campton-2023/) to learn more.** \n\n### Attribution:\n**Please cite the publication and underlying data as:**  \nLin, J.R., Chen, Y.A., Campton, D., et al., *Nature Cancer*, 2023, [DOI: 10.1038/s43018-023-00576-1](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-023-00576-1).\n\n**Please cite this Minerva Story as:**  \nJuliann Tefft, Yu-An Chen, Shannon Coy, Jia-Ren Lin, and Sarah Arena.

You can pan and zoom within the image at any time and return to the narration by toggling the arrows. Additionally, you can adjust the visible channels and access plain language descriptions of each channel by clicking the gear icon near the legend. Some channels include a lens that allows you to see the overlap between channels. On these pages, you can pick up and put down the lens, make it larger or smaller by dragging the lower right arrow, and fade the lens by pulling the semi-circle dial to the left. In the right column, we have pre-selected several channel groups for your convenience. Feel free to click on a different channel group at any time to explore a new set of markers.",

Several anatomical layers are identified and labeled. Starting from the top of the image, we have the mucosa, which borders the lumen. Moving toward the bottom of the image, we encounter the subserosa, which comprises a layer of fat and connective tissue. \n\nOn the right, we can observe a PanCK-positive tumor, specifically an invasive adenocarcinoma. This tumor is classified as pathological stage pT3, as it is located in the submucosa of the colorectum and has infiltrated the muscularis propria and subserosa (bottom right).\n\nWithin the tumor region, we can observe four holes, which indicate the areas where circular tissue cores were removed and transferred to another slide to build a tissue microarray (TMA) along with cores removed from other specimens.\n\nThroughout the tissue, we can observe multiple distinct, bright areas that contain many immune cells (CD45+). These are Peyer\u2019s patches and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS). We will discuss these structures in more detail later in the narration.",

Since the mucosa is in direct contact with the intestinal microbiome, the mucosa possesses resident populations of diverse immune cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells that help protect the body against unwanted infections.\n\nHere, we can also observe a collection of immune cells known as a Peyer\u2019s patch or secondary lymphoid organs, which are intermittently found in normal intestines, typically positioned at the interface between the mucosa and submucosa.

In this image, we can observe the presence of a CD20+ B-cell-rich germinal center, accompanied by numerous surrounding CD3+ T cells. Additionally, we can detect functional cell states, such as the abundant presence of PD-1-positive T cells.\n\nThe Orion method also makes it possible to directly compare IF-based molecular states and the corresponding morphologic features observed in H&E images. By examining identical cells on both IF and H&E, we can gain insights into whether different cell subtypes exhibit distinct morphologic appearances. For example, lymphocytes infiltrating the stroma may adopt an elongated morphology rather than the typical small round shape. These observations could potentially help uncover correlations between morphology and underlying molecular states.\n\n_To explore different immune channel groups, toggle the options listed in the right column.

While their relationship may not be evident on H&E-stained sections, using multiplexed immunofluorescence (IF) imaging provides further insights. Through IF, we can see that the lymphocytes interact with the tumor via cytoplasmic processes which are not visible on H&E. Notably, we can see direct interactions between the PD-L1+ tumor cells and CD8+ T cells. \n\n*(You may need to turn off all channels except PD-1 and PD-L1 to observe the PD1/PDL1 handshake in detail!)*\n\nBy leveraging multimodal imaging, we can also correlate these functional states and spatial interactions between tumor and immune cells to the underlying tissue morphology. This integrated approach has the potential to unveil previously concealed associations and provide a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay and tumultuous competition between the tumor and immune components in cancer tissues. \n",
