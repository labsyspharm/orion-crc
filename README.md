## Scientific summary

![Summary figure](./docs/Orion_fig1a.png)

Precision medicine is critically dependent on better methods for diagnosing and staging disease and predicting drug response. Histopathology using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained tissue - not genomics – remains the primary diagnostic modality in cancer. Moreover, recently developed, highly multiplexed tissue imaging represents a means of enhancing histology workflows with single cell mechanisms. Here we describe an approach for collecting and analyzing H&E and high-plex immunofluorescence (IF) images from the same cells in a whole-slide format suitable for translational and clinical research and eventual deployment in diagnosis. Using data from 40 human colorectal cancer resections (60 million cells) we show that IF and H&E images provide human experts and machine learning algorithms with complementary information. We demonstrate the automated generation and ranking of computational models, based either on immune infiltration or tumor-intrinsic features, that are highly predictive of progression-free survival. When these models are combined, a hazard ratio of ~0.045 is achieved, demonstrating the ability of multi-modal digital pathology to generate high-performance and interpretable biomarkers.

## Data availability

Full-resolution images, derived imaging data, and single-cell spatial feature tables will be released by the National Cancer Institute sponsored [repository for Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://htan-portal-nextjs.vercel.app/). While the public resource is still undergoing extensive development, we provided [exemplar data](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn38990468) via [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/#) for demonstration purposes. Light-weight image viewing for all the bio-specimens used in this study is made available using [Minerva](https://github.com/labsyspharm/minerva-story) and [Scope2Screen](https://github.com/labsyspharm/scope2screen).


### Exemplar data ([`syn38990468`](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn38990468))

To download, please refer to the [Synapse documentation](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Finding-and-Downloading-Data.2003796231.html)

## Codes for imaging data processing

Highplex Orion whole-slide images were processed using [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/) modules with customizations to cope with the large X-Y dimension in the dataset. Registration of Orion immunofluorescence images and post-Orion H&E images was done with [PALOM](https://github.com/yu-anchen/palom).


### Files in the `scripts-processing/` folder

To process Orion images into single tables, we ran `unmicst` and `S3segmenter` to generated labeled mask and run `quantification` using the segmentation mask and the 19-channel Orion image. Version and repositories of the processing modules is listed in the `github_repo.md` file.

- conda-env yaml files: environment specs for creating conda envs to run customized mcmicro modules
- `github_repo.md` file: version and repositories of the processing modules
- `.py` files: scripts for batch processing multiple input images
- `file_list.csv` file: file index for batch processing
- `markers.csv` file: antibody target names of channels in the Orion images

## Codes for single-cell spatial analysis

Single-cell spatial analysis was performed using [MATLAB 2019b]((https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)). To run the provided scripts on your data, please contact authors for more details.


### Demo for running the analysis and plotting scripts

```matlab
%% Optimize ImmuneScore

markers = {'CD3','CD8','CD45','CD45RO','CD68','CD163','CD4','CD20','SMA'};
regions = {'R1','R2'};

for i = 1:length(markers)
    for j = 1:length(regions)
        subplot(3,6,(i-1)*length(regions)+j);
        marker1 = strcat('norm_',markers{i},regions{j});
        list1 = sumAllsample{:,marker1};
        list2 = sumAllsample.PFSDays;
